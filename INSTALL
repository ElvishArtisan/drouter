This is the installation file for the drouter package.

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building GlassCoder:

The Switchyard5 Livewire library, v0.22.0 or better
 (https://github.com/ElvishArtisan/Switchyard)

Qt5 Toolkit, v5.9.7 or better (http://www.qt.io/).

Python 3.4 or better.

MySQL or MariaDB RDBMS.


OPTIONAL PREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Systemd Utility Library


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
The drouter man pages are written in XML-DocBook5.  Pre-generated troff
versions are included in the source tarball, so special tools will not
normally be required to install them.  However, if you need to rebuild them
(either because you've modified the DocBook sources or are installing from
the primary GitHub repository), then you will need the following:

XML-DocBook5 Stylesheets.  Available at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/.  You will also need to create a
$DOCBOOK_STYLESHEETS variable in you environment that points to the top
of the stylesheet tree.  More information can be found at
http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/appa.html#s.stylesheetinstall.

xsltproc.  Command line XSLT processor.  Available at
http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html


INSTALLATION
------------
Once the prerequisites are set up, building and installation of the code is
done by cd'ing to the top of the source tree and typing './configure
[options]', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those who
obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.  There
are a number of options for the 'configure' script; do './configure --help'
for a detailed list.

Before starting the 'drouter' service for the first time, you will need to
create a MySQL/MariaDB database, along with a user for accessing same. The
database name, user name and user password should all be 'drouter'. The
database is for the internal use of drouterd(8) server -- outside client
processes should *not* have access to it. The 'drouter' user should have
the following privileges for the database:

    Select
    Insert
    Update
    Delete
    Create
    Drop
    Index
    Lock Tables

For conveience, a 'drouter_init_db.sh' script is provided that will
create and configure the DB correctly when invoked as follows:

       drouter_init_db.sh <admin-name> <admin-pw>

Where <admin-name> and <admin-pw> are the user username/password of
a MySQL account with GRANT prvileges.
