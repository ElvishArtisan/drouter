This is the installation file for the drouter package.

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building GlassCoder:

Qt4 Toolkit, v4.6 or better (http://www.qt.io/).


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
The drouter man pages are written in XML-DocBook5.  Pre-generated troff
versions are included in the source tarball, so special tools will not
normally be required to install them.  However, if you need to rebuild them
(either because you've modified the DocBook sources or are installing from
the primary GitHub repository), then you will need the following:

XML-DocBook5 Stylesheets.  Available at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/.  You will also need to create a
$DOCBOOK_STYLESHEETS variable in you environment that points to the top
of the stylesheet tree.  More information can be found at
http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/appa.html#s.stylesheetinstall.

xsltproc.  Command line XSLT processor.  Available at
http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html


INSTALLATION
------------
Once the prerequisites are set up, building and installation of the code is
done by cd'ing to the top of the source tree and typing './configure
[options]', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those who
obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.  There
are a number of options for the 'configure' script; do './configure --help'
for a detailed list.


BUILDING ON RHEL 7
